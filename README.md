# The Arizona Weather Checker Web Application
This project is an independently created Python application that allows a user to select a city in Arizona to receive current and future hourly forecasts including temperature, humidity, and precipitation.
This program was made possible by the Open-Meteo weather forecast API. It contains ten Arizonan cities: Casa Grande, Flagstaff, Lake Havasu City, Page, Payson, Phoenix, Prescott, Sedona, Tucson, and Yuma.
Frontend was created using Streamlit, and the full application was deployed via Streamlit. An example of the webpage design and GUI is shown below:
