# The Arizona Weather Checker Web Application
This project is an independently created Python application that allows a user to select a city in Arizona to receive current and future hourly forecasts including temperature, humidity, and precipitation.
This program was made possible by the Open-Meteo weather forecast API. It currently contains Phoenix and Prescott, but other cities will be included very soon.
Frontend was created using Streamlit, and an example of the frontend design is shown below: N / A
